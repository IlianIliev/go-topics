# Go Topics

## Overview

This is a collection of examples illustrating different features and programming topics using Go language.
Browse the directories or pic one from the list below.

- Each topic is covered in a screencast session.
- Each folder contains a README.md file with a description of the topic and a link to the video


## Topics

- [Generics](./generics)
- [Interfaces, Testing and Mocking](./interfaces)


### Notes

- Some of those example may require a specific version of Go, in that case it will be indicated in the corresponding README.md
- The code samples here are not production ready code. To focus on the problems I am trying to illustrate, I may often simplify the code as so you may notice missing things like ignoring errors in some cases etc. Use this as a learning experience and not as a production ready code.
